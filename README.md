We are a small nonprofit with a simple mission to bring more **peace** and **love** into the world. If Google is the _brain_ of the internet, we want to become its _heart_.

## Family Bank

Any parent can open a **family bank** by calling `1-800-59-THANK` to receive a dedicated _family number_. By calling this number, any family member can create an account, and use texting commands such as _give_, _take_, _reward_, and _donate_. Family banks are interconnected through the settlement of bitcoins, and developers can take advantage of this ecosystem to build apps focused on the family.
